"""Assert that every hash-frozen study file still matches its manifest.

The Claude replication arm deliberately adds new files instead of editing frozen ones. This test
makes that discipline mechanical: if anyone edits a frozen artifact without writing an amendment
that records the new hash, the suite fails.

Amendments are applied in order, so a later amendment's corrected hash supersedes the base freeze.
Alphabetical globbing does not produce that order, because '-amendment-N.json' sorts before
'.json'.
